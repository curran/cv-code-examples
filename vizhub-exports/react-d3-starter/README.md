# React and D3 Integration Example

This project demonstrates a basic pattern for integrating
the D3.js library with a React application. React is used
for managing the component lifecycle and rendering the
initial DOM structure, while D3 is used to perform
imperative manipulations on a specific DOM element.

## How it Works

The integration follows these steps:

1.  **React Renders the Component**: The `App` component
    renders a single `<div>` element into the DOM.
2.  **Get a DOM Reference**: The `useRef` hook is attached
    to this `<div>`. This provides a direct, stable
    reference to the underlying DOM node once it's rendered.
3.  **Run D3 after Render**: A `useEffect` hook with an
    empty dependency array (`[]`) is used. This ensures its
    callback function runs only once, immediately after the
    component has been mounted to the DOM.
4.  **D3 Manipulates the DOM**: Inside the `useEffect`
    callback, D3's `select()` function targets the DOM node
    provided by the ref (`ref.current`). D3 then manipulates
    this element by setting its text content with the
    `.text()` method.

This approach leverages the strengths of both libraries:
React manages the overall component structure and lifecycle,
while D3 is given control over a specific part of the DOM to
perform complex or specialized manipulations, which is
common for data visualizations.

## APIs in Use

### React

- **`createRoot(element)`** (from `react-dom/client`):
  Creates a React root for the provided DOM container,
  enabling React's concurrent rendering features. This is
  the modern entry point for a React application.
- **`root.render(component)`**: Renders a React element
  (e.g., `<App />`) into the created root.
- **`useRef()`**: A hook that returns a mutable `ref`
  object. Its `.current` property is used here to get a
  direct reference to the `<div>` DOM element rendered by
  the component. This reference persists across re-renders.
- **`useEffect(callback, dependencies)`**: A hook for
  running side effects in function components. By using it
  with an empty dependency array `[]`, the `callback`
  function is executed only once, after the initial render.
  This makes it the ideal place to integrate with
  third-party libraries like D3 that need to access the DOM.

### D3

- **`select(node)`**: The core function of D3's selection
  module. It selects a single DOM element. In this project,
  it takes the DOM node from `ref.current` and wraps it in a
  D3 selection object, which can then be manipulated by
  other D3 methods.
- **`.text(value)`**: A method on a D3 selection that sets
  the text content of the selected element(s). Here, it sets
  the text of the `<div>` to "hello D3 and react".
